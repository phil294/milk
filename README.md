# Milk

http://waritschlager.de/milk.html

## Building locally

Run `./build.sh`, then open `milk.html` in your browser

## Layout

The layout can be changed primarily by changing the order of the DEFINITIONS in `milk.mmd`. This is very fragile and can result in a complete mess just by moving any single line. Because of this, the mermaid (cli/docker) version is fixed in place in `build.sh`, but there may be room for improvement.
